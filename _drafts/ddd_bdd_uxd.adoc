== Introduction

Rough draft!!! At the moment this is mostly a brain dump... Need to think more
about the core point(s) and target audience...

During CukeUp 2015 I did a quick sketch of how I tend to think about the
relationships between Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Behaviour-Driven Development
(BDD) and User Experience Design (UXD). Each of these is a different discipline,
yet when I coach a team or work on a team I try to bring an integrated approach
to the problems at hand.

This is a model that tries to describe how I think about the complemetary
relationship between the disciplines of DDD, BDD and UXD. The model is _integrative_,
in that tries to take a _holistic_ view of the three disciplines.

Replace above image with high quality one (perhaps include the rough sketch
above at the end of the article to show the evolution of the idea).

I propose this simple model as a way of thinking about the commonalities and
differences between these three approaches, with the goal of helping others
see them and experiment with combining approaches to get the best of all three.

So, this model is wrong. It leaves out a lot of things, and maybe will create
the wrong impression for some people. But with the goal of driving towards a
more intergrated way of thinking, hopefully it will be very useful. And encourage
people to look beyond their own discipline and explore incorporating others.

Thanks to feedback from Mathias, Konstantin, Julien, Matt, Gaspar and Ulrika.

Starting with design, the two approaches that focus most on this are UXD and DDD,
with UXD focused more on perceptual design (how the user interacts with the system)
and DDD on conceptual design (the underlying system structure and various models
  expressed in software and how they interact). I

== DDD Distinctives

* Domain model exploration
* Creative collaboration between technical practitioners and domain practitioners/experts
* Conceptual modeling
* Strategic design - context mapping and domain distillation
* Event storming ("stickies to code"), especially for event-based architectures.
* Emphasizes using tests to drive the design as part of "code probes" to implement
key parts of the model and verify its usefulness. Eric tends to use unit tests to
probe object contracts/shape, but more generally the DDD community practices TDD.
* Model exploration whirlpool
* Clean separation of domain model from other concerns (infrastructure, UI etc)

Some other things about DDD:

* especially suited to complex business domains
* CQRS
* Event sourcing

== BDD Distinctives

* Test automation
* Living documentation/executable specification
* Emphasis on importance of tester role in collaboratively verifying behaviour

Aslak on TDD as part of BDD:

[quote]
""
BDD started out as TDD, replacing the word "test" with "should" to help people
understand that TDD is not about testing, but about design and reflection. The
word "should" might not have caught on, but we have learned that choosing the
right words can have a deep impact on how we think.

When it's time to write code, BDD is no different from TDD. Write a failing
test. Watch it fail. Write enough code to make it pass. Clean up your mess
(refactor).
""

From Aslak on BDD "technical stuff":

* Modelling by Example - enforce a ubiquitous language right into your domain mode
* Automate most of your tests through the domain, not the UI (brittle and slow)
* Don't aim for high test coverage with BDD. It's for discovery of your domain, not for testing the implementation.

== Things Shared Between BDD and DDD

* Ubiquitous language
* TDD (red-green-refactor). In BDD it's at the stakeholder (acceptance test) level, in DDD its more
likely to push down into microtesting (unit, integration etc). This may be a
contentious statement, I'm not sure. TDD is primarily about emergent design
through the refactor step, which supports both DDD and BDD. DDD tends to focus
more on refactoring _concepts_ (making things that are implicit, explicit).

== UXD Distinctives

* Personas
* Mockups
* Visual design

=== Lean UX

As a subspecies of UXD. Incorporates Lean Startup techniques and philosophy. Much greater and more-frequent customer involvement.

* "Proto-personas"


== Things Shared Between BDD and UXD

* Focus on user behaviour/intention via the user interface
*

== Things Shared Between DDD and UXD

* Strong emphasis on primacy of design
* UX is an important source of information for DDD

== Things Common to All Three Approaches

Focus on:

* achieving customer value as early and often as possible
* understanding the problem/business domain
* using real-world examples
* cross-discipline conversations and collaboration
* specific applications of the agile manifesto values and principles
* experimentation
* iterative approach

Expand on each of these. Refer to https://cukes.info/blog/2015/03/27/aslaks-view-of-bdd[Aslak's view of BDD].

Some (other) ideas to consider:

* BDD doesn't pay (much) attention to bounded context in terms of ubiquitous
language. This may be a nice way to highlight what DDD brings to the table.
* BDD introduces consistency and rigor to the ubiquitous language (c.f. Gojko)
through specification workshops and enforcement via acceptance tests exercising
the ubiquitous language.
* There's been much dialog in the BDD community about declarative vs imperative
steps in scenarios. This seems more a case of the need for domain modeling
to model the missing (i.e. implicit) domain concepts, so they can be added to
the steps (c.f. http://dannorth.net/2011/01/31/whose-domain-is-it-anyway/).

Maybe should incorporate some of the important ideas from the "Recipe for success"
in Gojko's "DDD, BDD, TDD presentation" from DDDx 2010. Slides at
http://www.slideshare.net/skillsmatter/ddd-exchange-2010-gojko-adzic-on-ddd-tdd-bdd:

* Use strategic design to decide what to build
* Use feature injection to get the scope
* Evolve a ubiquitous language with specification workshops
* Establish guidelines with collaborative high-lvel domain design
* TDD design below, respecting DDD guidelines
* Use context mapping to facilitate cross-team collaboration


== Conclusion

Somethign here about my own experiences with taking an integrative approach.
