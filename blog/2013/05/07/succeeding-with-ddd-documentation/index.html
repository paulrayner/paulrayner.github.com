    <div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m often asked about what teams doing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) should do in the way of documentation. The question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16284767/what-types-of-written-design-documents-are-used-in-ddd-projects">What types of Written Design Documents are used in DDD projects?</a> came up on Stack Overflow and I started to write a response, but realized it was getting way too long to post there. So here it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it comes to documentation, we need to begin with the end in mind.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need
to understand why we are writing it in the first place: What purpose is each
document intending to serve?</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with a lot of documentation is that it is seen as an end in
itself, rather than a means to an end, which is to deliver a quality product
that meets an important customer need.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why agile teams adopt the value of "working software over comprehensive documentation."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, documentation serves a number of important, and different, purposes.
For each documentation artifact, ask: "Is this artifact to support the team
now as it develops the software, or is it to support future development?"
Depending on the answer to this question, approach the documentation in a
different way. Let&#8217;s start with supporting future development.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="the-problem-of-tribal-mythology">The Problem of Tribal Mythology</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jason Smith in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elemental-Design-Patterns-Jason-Smith/dp/0321711920">Elemental Design Patterns</a> says the following about kinds of
documentation supporting future development:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We know we should document our software; we know we should keep it up to
date; we know we should commit to pen or screen the whys, the hows, and the
reasons; but we also know it is a pain. It really is, so we don’t do it. What
we have instead is a body of knowledge that is locked within the heads of
developers, that is passed along in fits and spurts, when prompted and only
where necessary, frequently without any comprehensive framework of common
understanding among stakeholders.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Jason points out, Grady Booch has popularized the phrase “tribal knowledge”
for this kind of information artifact. Documenting for the future preserves
the oral tradition by encoding knowledge that already exists. It supports the
later transmission, socializing and sustainability of the "tribal knowledge"
of the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So one type of documentation we create supports future development by
preserving the oral tradition that teams develop along with the software.
Without this kind of documentation "&#8230;&#8203;the collected tribal knowledge degrades
into “tribal mythology” (Booch). When this happens, no one really knows how
the system ended up the way it has, and the knowledge is lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of supporting, future-facing documentation is particularly relevant
where such knowledge is not immediately apparent by reading the code,
supporting tests and other artifacts. Such documentation is typically
written after features/modules are implemented/delivered. It can be produced
as the software is being built, but then there is the additional maintenance
cost of keeping it up-to-date as things change.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="preserving-tribal-wisdom">Preserving Tribal Wisdom</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we want to avoid tribal mythology by documenting our systems as necessary.
We want to capture and preserve for people to come the "tribal wisdom" that
has been gained in the rough-and-tumble of developing the system. As Jason
points out:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tribal wisdom, however, is the virtuous flip side of this tribal mythology.
It is prescribed action with understanding, how accompanied by why, and is
adaptable to new environments, new situations, and new problems. It transcends
rote copying, and provides illumination through a comprehensive discussion of
the reasons behind the action.</p>
</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Jason Smith<br>
<cite>Elemental Design Patterns</cite>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point in the past, for almost every
action or decision in a system, someone knew why it was done that way.
Carrying those decisions forward, even the small ones, can be critical. Small
decisions accrete into large systems, and small designs build into large
designs. By ensuring that we have a strong tradition of knowledge retention
that facilitates understanding, we build a tradition of tribal wisdom.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="favor-documenting-over-documentation">Favor Documenting over Documentation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we support future development by preserving tribal wisdom through
documentation, but what about supporting the team as they develop the product?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the same sense that agile teams favor planning over following a plan, they
tend to favor documenting (as an ongoing, just-in-time, activity) over
creating a (once-and-for all) document. And in the same manner that their
planning is focused around high-fidelity communication, customer collaboration
and team interaction, any documenting they do tends to have the same goals and
characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A plan is only useful until it needs to change, which is why agile teams focus
on enabling and responding to change. The intention is the same with any
documentation they create in service to building a software solution - it
should not be painful, but rather serve the team in better understanding the
problem space, and helping the team grasp what the solution needs to look
like. Let&#8217;s look at some important characteristics of this style of
documentation:</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="characteristics-of-useful-documentation">Characteristics of Useful Documentation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trustworthy">Trustworthy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This should have to go without saying but, like comments in code, much of the
documentation that exists cannot be trusted. If you have documents that are
supporting your development, make them living documents by keeping them up to
date. They must be correct. They must speak the truth about the software and
the business domain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="malleable">Malleable</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of keeping documents trustworthy is enabling change. Documentation must
be malleable - make it as easy to change as possible. Reduce the friction of
having to change it. Documentation that is burdensome to change is less likely
to be kept up-to-date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Makeing it malleable typically means making it as lightweight and informal as
possible. Prefer hand-drawn diagrams over created in a tool (such as Visio),
prefer electronic over hard-copy. Only include the pertinent details. Indicate
which things are tentitive, and which may be harder to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The important thing is to understand the purpose of each document, and ensure
that it is kept up to date. As much as possible, push the knowledge into the
code and the tests.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="accessible">Accessible</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentation must be as accessible as necessary. Things that the team is
working on right now, I would expect to be on the walls of the team area. Just
the same as many teams use information radiators such as burndown charts and
task boards to track their delivery progress, I like to see sketches of design
diagrams on the walls too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I like to see a context map on the wall, showing the terrain the team is
dealing with. I&#8217;ve worked with many teams that were not co-located, so we
would put the the documents in shared folders, and on the wiki. Sometimes we
would sketch on a whiteboard, and then take a photo of the diagram and put it
on the team wiki.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t let your wiki fall prey to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy of the Commons</a>. Appoint a curator for your documents if necessary. But strive for team-ownership of the documentation, just as you strive for team ownership of the
code.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="documentation-and-doing-ddd">Documentation and Doing DDD</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DDD teams often find they have a leg-up with documentation, because they
devote so much effort to distilling domain knowledge into the software itself
via the domain model. Teams doing DDD are focused capturing the essence of the
critical concepts of the core domain in the domain model <em>itself</em>. With DDD
the rules, reasoning, assumptions and key business concepts are embedded in
the software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I start with a team, the first thing we draw together is a context map.
This diagram helps set them up for success in terms of knowing what context
they are working in, how it relates to their core domain and the other
contexts they need to interact with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For DDD teams, and for software teams in general, the important thing should
be not that the domain is documented, it is that it is <em>understood</em>, and that
this understanding is shared among everyone connected with developing the
software. Good documentation engenders a shared understanding of the business
domain. Good documentation for a DDD team captures the essence of the
reasoning around the domain model: a rich, expressive software model that
enables significant business capabilities in the core domain, supporting the
strategic goals of the business. Teams doing DDD accomplish this by
simplifying domain complexity enough to provide a shared language and
understanding, and embedding it in the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DDD is not prescriptive about documentation. What documents are produced
usually has more to do with the team&#8217;s existing process than doing DDD.
However, there are certain kinds of documentation that teams doing DDD do find
very helpful. Let&#8217;s look at some of these.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="requirements-specification">Requirements Specification?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many teams opt for user stories as items in a feature queue, prioritized by value to the business
(i.e. "Product Backlog", in Scrum terms). See my earlier blog post on <a href="http://thepaulrayner.com/blog/2013/02/15/agile-user-stories-and-domain-driven-design-ddd/">user stories and DDD</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A team doing DDD could use a requirements specification document. But the trap with heavyweight, detailed specification documents is that they tend to <a href="http://www.leanessays.com/2011/08/dont-separate-design-from.html">separate design from implementation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="title">Don&#8217;t Separate Design from Implementation</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The theme running through all of my experience is that the long list of
things we have come to call requirements – and the large backlog of things we
have come to call stories – are actually the design of the system. Even a
list of features and functions is design. And in my experience, design is the
responsibility of the technical team developing the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Mary Poppendieck
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I suggest we might get better results if we skip writing lists of
requirements and building backlogs of stories. Instead, expect the
experienced designers, architects, and engineers on the development team to
design the system against a set of high-level goals and constraints – with
input from and review by business analysts and product managers, as well as
users, maintainers, and other stakeholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Mary Poppendieck
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile teams tend to eschew producing detailed requirements specifications,
preferring a more light-weight approach to describing what the system needs to
do. The problem with such documents is that design decisions are made too
early, with insufficient domain and technical knowledge, and having it written
up in a specification tends to set that ignorance in concrete.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All too often, detailed requirements lists and backlogs of stories are
actually bad system design done by amateurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Mary Poppendieck
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The risk in this approach is that:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Separating design from implementation amounts to outsourcing the
responsibility for the suitability of the resulting system to people outside
the development team. The team members are then in a position of simply doing
what they are told to do, rather than being full partners collaborating to
create great solutions to problems that they care about.</p>
</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Mary Poppendieck
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most teams I coach are following some form of agile process (Scrum, XP etc)
and thus tend to focus more on rapid feedback loops and incremental
development over producing copious amounts of documentation first. This tends
to aid with modeling, as the documentation is produced as-needed, rather than
to get through some "gate" in a prescribed SDLC process. The code itself is
the design, paraphrasing Jack Reeves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some teams find it helpful to develop a list of use cases, a list of tasks the
program is able to perform or some combination of both. I would experiment
with what you find most useful for your team. Use cases have fallen out of
vogue recently, but I am still a big fan of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that I am not against specifying requirements in written form, but rather entombing those requirements (i.e. what features the system should provide to meet the customer&#8217;s needs) in a large tome that locks-in the details of how the system should behave. I have utilized use cases in a lightweight, just-in-time way and found them very useful. See Alistair Cockburn&#8217;s article on <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Why+I+still+use+use+cases">Why I still use use cases</a> for similar reasons to mine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would also strongly recommend using mockups and prototypes as much as
possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="core-elements">Core Elements</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I typically create a short document that captures the core domain vision
statement and the context map.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architecture is largely orthogonal, but supportive, for DDD. I find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">"4+1 architecture" approach</a> to be the most useful. It is useful to keep in mind that, as Grady Booch declared in 2009, architecture is a <em>shared hallucination</em>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architecture is just a collective hunch, a shared hallucination, an assertion by a set of stakeholders on the nature of their observable world, be it a world that is or a world as they wish it to be. Architecture therefore serves as a means of anchoring an extended set of stakeholders to a common vision of that world, a vision around which they may rally, to which they are led, and for which they work collectively to make manifest.</p>
</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Grady Booch
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that in Krutchen&#8217;s approach, scenarios are the unifying thing.
Reference scenarios are a more specific form of this. See <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/paulrayner-domain-scenarios">my presentation on
domain scenarios at the DDD Exchange 2012</a> for a walkthrough of using reference
scenarios. In DDD <em>reference</em> scenarios describe the <em>key business problems
that the model needs to solve</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reference scenarios will be the core domain business capabilities that the
software, and in particular, the domain model, will enable. They often take
the form of a short narrative, with a supporting diagram. Not starting out
that way, but the key is capture the significant details that make the problem
worth solving for the business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>George Fairbanks book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Just-Enough-Software-Architecture-Risk-Driven/dp/0984618104/">Just-Enough Software Architecture</a> is the best book I&#8217;ve found on characterizing, describing and documenting software archtictures. I love the pragmatic, risk-driven approach to architecture that this book takes (the sections on modeling alone are excellent, though it defines DDD too narrowly for my taste). If you are looking for something more comprehensive in the software engineering tradition, then it&#8217;s hard to beat the definitive tome: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Documenting-Software-Architectures-Views-Beyond/dp/0321552687">Documenting Software Architectures</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="ubiquitous-language">Ubiquitous language</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be helpful having a document that explains the Ubiquitous Language.
Many teams develop a dictionary of significant business terms early on, and
for a team with a business analyst this can be a very significant
contribution. However, the same caveats mentioned above relating to separating
design from implementation are particularly relevant:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most software development processes I have encountered, a business analyst or product owner has been assigned the job of writing the requirements or stories or use cases which constitute the design of the system. Quite frankly, people in these roles often lack the training and experience to do good system design, to propose alternative designs and weigh their trade-offs, to examine implementation details and modify the design as the system is being developed.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So as with all the documents described here, the dictionary must be kept up to
date to be useful. Such a dictionary can be an important start, but it
shouldn&#8217;t be the end. I like to see it developed into a document that has
diagrams showing important states of the model, and how the terminology of the
domain model is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As terms change over time, such a document can be a good place to explain why
these changes in language were made, since that kind of historical information
won&#8217;t be obvious by looking at the code etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="informal-uml-diagrams">Informal UML diagrams</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am always sketching UML diagrams on whiteboards. It saddens me that many
teams don&#8217;t see the value in this. I particularly find instance diagrams
particularly useful in walking through scenarios with domain experts. I find
that when the domain experts see the concrete, pertinent business data values
in the "little boxes" in the diagram, it really helps with  understanding what
the model is expressing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many times when I work with a team that has an existing model, one of the
first things I will have the developers do is walk me and the domain expert
through a reference scenario on the whiteboard, explaining how the model
supports solving the important business problem. This activity alone is often
enough to show strengths and weaknesses of the domain model. Instance diagrams
also really help with understanding aggregate boundaries, since aggregates are
runtime artifacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sequence diagrams can be very helpful for understanding the application flow
from the UI, API, or context boundary down to the domain model. And also in
understanding interactions between sagas, objects, domain services or
aggregates (such as via application services or other infrastucture
responsible for eventual consistency between aggregates).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create electronic versions such I often use light-weight UML sketch tools
such as [Web Sequence Diagrams](<a href="http://www.websequencediagrams.com" class="bare">http://www.websequencediagrams.com</a>) and [yUML](<a href="http://yuml.me" class="bare">http://yuml.me</a>). I like
the way these tools produce diagrams that look hand-drawn, which lends them
towards being viewed as transient and gives the team permission to change
them. One of the problems with producing high-quality UML diagrams is that it
tends to communicate that they are "done," and shouldn&#8217;t be changed. That they
are finished.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="anything-else">Anything else?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan BDD tool such as Cucumber to create living documentation for
the system, if the team has the skills and experience with such a tool. For
example, the following feature file helps support the ubiquitous language
supporting the underlying conceptual model represented in the domain model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m biased towards Cucumber as a tool because I like the separation of steps
in feature files and stepdefinitions encourages the separation of ubiquitous
language from the technical implementation. The business terminology goes in
the feature files, and should be refactored as the ubiquitous language is
refined over time.</p>

<p>I am co-authoring the book <em>BDD with Cucumber</em> for Pearson/Addison Wesley. The book will
cover doing BDD using Cucumber (Ruby), Cucumber-JVM and SpecFlow.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it&#8217;s not the tool that&#8217;s most important, the same thing could be done with
other acceptance testing frameworks such as Concordian, Fitnesse or Robot
Framework. There&#8217;s an interesting discussion going on right now on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/aa-ftt/message/1976">Agile
Alliance Functional Testing Tools (AA-FTT) mailing list</a> about these
frameworks and the various tradeoffs they provide. The important thing is the
improvements I see in communication and collaboration when teams use these
tools to refine acceptance criteria for user stories.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No preference for this. Most teams work this kind of thing out on their own
over time. I&#8217;m not even sure what the factors are for deciding whether to
combine documents or not. My preference is to keep documents short and
focused. I find they are more likely to be read and used if they are concise
and cohesive - maybe principles of good software module design could be
pertinent in structuring documents too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My preference is for diagrams surrounded by text. If a picture is worth a 1000
words, supporting text that explains the critical aspects of the diagram is a
multiplier for this in terms of utility.</p>

<h2 id="respect-your-audience">Respect Your Audience</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, and most importantly, when writing any software documentation
consider your audience. Will the readers be coders? testers? domain experts?
all of the above? Is this technical documentation, or business-facing
documentation? How you answer these questions should factor strongly in terms
of what kinds of information you include in the document, particularly how
much technical detail you incorporate.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s probably a lot of things I&#8217;ve missed here. What has been your experience with doing DDD in terms of documentation?</p>
