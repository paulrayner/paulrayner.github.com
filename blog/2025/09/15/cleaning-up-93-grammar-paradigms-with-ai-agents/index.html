  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Last week I had to deal with a mess I’d been putting off for way too long.</p>

<p>Working on my Biblical Hebrew learning app, I’ve built up 93 different grammar paradigms (patterns showing how words change form in different contexts) over time - verbs, adjectives, prepositions, pronouns, etc. Each one has morphological notes and Biblical examples.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ai-cleanup/2025-09-12 binah paradigms app screenshot.png" alt="Hebrew paradigms in the app interface" /></p>

<p>The problem: I’ve been learning as I go, which means my earlier work looked… different from my later work. Really different. The inconsistency was bugging me, but manually reviewing and standardizing 93 paradigms across 6 files felt overwhelming.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ai-cleanup/2025-09-12 binah paradigms compliance report.png" alt="Initial compliance report showing inconsistent paradigms" /></p>

<p>So I decided to scale up an approach I’d been using for smaller cleanups - letting AI agents handle the audit and fix work, but this time across multiple files in parallel.</p>

<p>First, I had Claude examine all the paradigms and create a structure guide. After I reviewed and tweaked that guide, I set multiple Claude Code agents to work simultaneously - each one auditing a different file, checking compliance against the guide, and implementing the fixes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ai-cleanup/2025-09-12 binah paradigms structure guide.png" alt="The structure guide that became our compliance standard" /></p>

<p>I cross-validated some of the results with ChatGPT 5 to make sure the assessments were accurate (e.g. “Is this form actually included in this verse?”), and validated some things across Hebrew grammars.</p>

<p>Of course, it wasn’t all smooth. The agents initially gave some wildly incorrect audit results (0% compliance for some verb patterns that were actually fine!), and Claude’s first parallelization approach would have sliced work across cleanup tasks rather than files. Had to iterate on the approach.</p>

<p>But once we got the division of work right - one agent per paradigm category file - it worked beautifully. Ended up with 100% compliance across all 93 paradigms in about a half-day’s work for everything.</p>

<p>The final results were exactly what I was hoping for:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ai-cleanup/2025-09-12 binah paradigms compliance report 2.png" alt="Final compliance report showing 100% compliance" /></p>

<p>A few things that made this work:</p>

<p>→ <strong>File separation helped</strong> - Each paradigm category lives in its own file (pronouns, questions, imperatives, copulas, etc.) with clear responsibilities. Made it possible to process them in parallel.</p>

<p>→ <strong>Good division of labor</strong> - The agents handled the tedious, detailed work while I focused on figuring out what the structure should actually be.</p>

<p>→ <strong>Parallel agents changed everything</strong> - Instead of processing files sequentially, I had multiple agents working simultaneously - each auditing and fixing a different file for compliance. Turned what could have been weeks into hours.</p>

<p>Here’s a recording of the parallel cleanup process in action:</p>

<video width="100%" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls="" poster="/assets/ai-cleanup/2025-09-12 binah-parallel-cleanup-edited-and-15x-thumbnail.png">
  <source src="/assets/ai-cleanup/cleanup-process-web.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. <a href="/assets/ai-cleanup/cleanup-process-web.mp4">Download the video</a> to see the 7.5-minute cleanup process (sped up 15x).</p>
</video>

<p><em>7.5-minute cleanup process, sped up 15x</em></p>

<p>→ <strong>Built-in compliance checking</strong> - Each agent audited against the structure guide before implementing fixes, then validated the results. Gave me confidence the cleanup was thorough and consistent.</p>

<p>The nice surprise was that while the audit step was running, I could work on other parts of the app. Then I left the fix steps running after I was done for the day and checked the results the next morning.</p>

<p>Going through this process also showed me that some files have grown too big - the verb paradigms file now has 19 different patterns, so I’ll be looking for ways to break down some of the larger ones into more focused files.</p>

<p>Not sure how long this would have taken me manually, but I probably would have gotten distracted and never finished because of higher priorities.</p>

<p>Looking at my recent commits, about 75% of my work lately has been maintenance - bug fixes, documentation updates, and cleanup tasks like this. That’s a lot of non-feature work that benefits from this kind of systematic approach.</p>

<p>Breaking it down from my last 50 commits (6 days):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>30% bug fixes</strong> - UI tweaks, API corrections, responsive design</li>
  <li><strong>32% documentation</strong> - compliance reports, planning docs, structure guides</li>
  <li><strong>12% cleanup/refactoring</strong> - code formatting, citation standardization</li>
  <li><strong>24% new features</strong> - the fun stuff</li>
  <li><strong>2% configuration</strong> - deployment, tooling changes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A few lessons learned:</strong></p>

<p>→ <strong>I still have a lot to learn about using agents effectively.</strong> This isn’t the easiest part of Claude Code to figure out, and I probably need to re-read the <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub_agents">sub-agents guide</a> to get better at this.</p>

<p>→ <strong>A naive approach doesn’t work.</strong> It’s clear I often don’t provide enough context for the AI to figure out what it needs to do. Asking questions and getting recommendations is a key part of the process.</p>

<p>→ <strong>I’m making mistakes, but I’m happy with my progress.</strong> This type of development is actually fun for me - it dramatically reduces the busy work I used to have to do.</p>

<p>→ <strong>Tasks that used to feel tedious are now enjoyable and quick</strong> compared to how they used to feel.</p>

<p>Anyone else using AI for large-scale cleanup tasks like this? Curious what approaches have worked for you.</p>
