<p>Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience by Gothelf &amp; Seiden comes in at just over 100 pages, so it&#8217;s a quick read. But it&#8217;s full of very practical guidance for how to apply lean principles to user experience design (UXD). Published in 2013, it won a Jolt Award. Here I captured quotes and notes I thought were interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If anything below looks interesting to you, run - don&#8217;t walk - and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652/">buy Lean UX</a>. It&#8217;s <em>that</em> good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a couple of quotes from Eric Ries in the forward that I thought were great:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
The problem is the systems we use to build companies. We are still building linear organizations in a world that demands constant change. We are still building silos in a world that demands thorough collaboration.
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Eric Ries<br>
<cite>from the forward, p. xi</cite>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve never heard the phrase "linear organizations" before, but it&#8217;s a great way to describe the kind of siloing I see every day in the organizations I coach in agile. Two types of siloing are especially prelevant. One is specialty-based, the other software architecture/component-based. Many organizations have both kinds of silos.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specialty-based organizations are structured around the roles people play in a serial, "gated", "waterfall" software development lifecycle. That is, there are UX designers for the design phase, architects for architecture in the design phase, BAs for analysis in the analysis phase, developers for the construction phase, testers for the QA phase, operations staff for the deployment phase, and so on. Each phase is gated based on the delivery of documentation, and a review of that documentation. Basically, such a process treats the entire deliverable as a single batch of work, it&#8217;s the opposite of the 4 values in the agile manifesto.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
&#8230;&#8203;We are still investing in analysis, arguing over specifications, and efficiently producing deliverables in a world that demands continuous experimentation to achieve continuous innovation.
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Eric Ries<br>
<cite>from the forward, p. xi</cite>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conway&#8217;s Law is commonly expressed as organizations structured around component-based teams, where the organizational structure matches the architecture of the software. Feature-based cross-functional teams organized around customer outcomes are how agile typically tries to "hack" Conway&#8217;s Law by maintaining software boundaries but incorporating all the people needed across the system architecture to ship a customer feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
&#8230;&#8203;heed Jeff Gothelf&#8217;s call to 'get out of the deliverables business' and return our focus where it belongs, enlisting the whole corporation in its most urgent task: delighting customers.
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Eric Ries<br>
<cite>from the forward, p. xi</cite>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is something I have thought about a lot when it comes to doing BDD well. Team members need to willing to make getting early feedback a priority, instead of only showing things to others when they are "done". Early feedback is best.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
As I&#8217;ve learned to practice Lean UX, I&#8217;ve had to overcome the feeling that I was showing work that was "ugly," "unfinished," or "not ready." Working this way requires the support of a high-functioning team. You need to know - as a team - that you&#8217;re not going to get it right the first time and that you&#8217;re all working together to iterate your way forward.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a video called "Why You Need to Fail" (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhxcFGuKOys" class="bare">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhxcFGuKOys</a>), CD Baby founder Derek Sivers describes the surprising results of a ceramics class. On the first day, the instructor announced to his class that the students would be divided into two groups. Half of the students would need to make only one clay pot each during the semester. Their grades would depend on the perfection of that solitary pot. The other half of the class would be graded simply by the weight of the pots they made during the semester. If they made 50 pounds of pots or more, they&#8217;d get an A. Forty pounds would earn a B; 30 pounds, a C; and so on. WHat they actuall made was irrelevant. The istructor said he wouldn&#8217;t even look at the pots. He would bring his bathroom scale to the final day of class and weigh each student&#8217;s work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the semester, an interesting thing had occurred. Outside observers of the class notes that the highest-quality pots had been made by the "quantity group." They had spent the entire semester working as quickly as they could to make pots. Sometimes they succeeded, and sometimes they failed. With each iteration, each experiment, they learned. From their learning, they became better able to achieve the end goal: making high-quality clay pots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By contrast, the group that made one object didn&#8217;t have the benefit of those failed iterations and didn&#8217;t learn as quickly enough to perform at the same level as the "quantity group." They had spent their semester theorizing about what would make a "grade-A" pot but didn&#8217;t have the experience to execute that grandiose vision.</p>

Teams rarely learn or get better from working with heroes. Instead, <strong>designing together increases the design IQ of the entire team.</strong> It allows every memeber of the team to articulate his or her ideas. It gives designers a broader set of ideas to draw upon as they refine the user experence. This collaboration, in turn, breeds incleased feelings of ownership over the work being done by the entire team. Finally, collaborative design builds team-wide shared understanding.

<p>Stay agile - focus on being able to make updates quickly</p>
