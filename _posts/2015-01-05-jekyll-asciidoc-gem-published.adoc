Announcing the release of https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[jekyll-asciidoc], a http://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] plugin that converts AsciiDoc files in your site source to HTML pages using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor].
q:>[Start writing your web content in Jekyll using all the richness and clarity of AsciiDoc.]
The jekyll-asciidoc gem was written by Dan Allen (https://twitter.com/mojavelinux[@mojavelinux]) and I have https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-asciidoc[published the release 1.0.0 version to RubyGems].


Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, enabling you to convert plain text content into static websites and blogs. Until recently, Jekyll only supported http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown] (or http://redcloth.org/textile[Textile]) formatted content.

Jekyll 2.0 introduced a new plugin type called a http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#converters[Converter] that transforms any markup into HTML. This frees the writer up to compose content however she chooses, and Jekyll will just serve the final HTML. For example, you can write your posts in AsciiDoc, if that's your thing.

Yes, that _is_ my thing. This post is actually written in AsciiDoc and is being rendered using jekyll-asciidoc.

TIP: GitHub doesn’t (yet) whitelist the AsciiDoc plugin, so you can only run it on your own machine. I set up a Travis CI job to automate publishing of this site to GitHub Pages.

Here's the actual AsciiDoc content for this blog post. You can see the original file in https://github.com/paulrayner/paulrayner.github.com/blob/jekyll/_posts/2015-01-05-jekyll-asciidoc-gem-published.adoc[my website source repository on GitHub].
