The definitive work is now https://my.aami.org/store/detail.aspx?id=TIR45[AAMI TIR45:2012], a technical information report created by the AAMI to provide guidance on the use of agile practices in the development of medical device software. It is currently $150 to download a pdf ($90 for AAMI members). You can also http://marketplace.aami.org/eseries/scriptcontent/docs/Preview%20Files/TIR45_1208_preview.pdf[download a preview].
