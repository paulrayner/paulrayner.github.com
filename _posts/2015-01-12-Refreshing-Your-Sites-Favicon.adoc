What do you do when you've updated the `favicon.ico` file on your server, but your browser is still showing the old one? It's probably browser caching issue, so if you need to do a local refresh, look no further (see below if it's actually a server issue). This post will teach you how to force a favicon refresh, using a technique that works locally and doesn't require code changes.

This is based on one of the answers to the Stack Overflow question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2208933/how-do-i-force-a-favicon-refresh[How do I force a favicon refresh]? Last time I had to do this for a Rails app my Google-fu was apparentely too week to find the answer, so I'm posting the solution for next time I have to do it.

Once you've updated `favicon.ico`, which lives in `/public` for a Rails app, the two simple steps are:

. Type in `www.yoursite.com/favicon.ico` for the browser URL and press Enter <- where `www.yoursite.com` is the URL for your app, which could be something like `localhost:3000`
. Press Ctrl+f5

Now when you navigate to the URL for your website the `favicon.ico` icon which shows in the browser tab should be the new one. Works for me!

You should be able to force browsers to download a new version using the link tag and a querystring on your filename, such as:

    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://www.yoursite.com/favicon.ico?v=2" />

This is especially helpful in production environments to make sure your users get the update. If this still doesn't work, you might want to look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077041/refresh-image-with-a-new-one-at-the-same-url[context expiration of some kind]. You may still need to use the technique above to get your local browser to update though.
