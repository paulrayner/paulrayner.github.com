cloud is a different lifestyle, not a replacement for your data center (not just infrastructure)
"Enterprise cloud" - violates NIST properties

Need to rethink and rework the way your IT works.

Why run software you didn't build? Do SAAS instead. Cloud CRM, SAP in the cloud etc. Vector here is clear.

It's not about infrastructure, it's about application developement and delivery.

Need to have a good idea why you are doing it (multi-cloud flavors). Having an architectureal thought about it and understanding the patterns are and choosing wisely. Portable is rare (looks good on paper, but more like a shiney Ferrari). What you need, what brings you value, and what architecture stands behind it.

Nothing is free - be aware of tradeoffs.

Hybrid cloud - many ways to slice to elephant.

Cost savings have to be earned. Moving from on-prem to cloud (migration) will shave some money off. The biggest one is optimizing what you have. Making it resilient.

Transparency (cloud -> optimized). See all the servers not doing much. Redundant machines. This is actually where the money is. Need to move beyond cloud to optimized.

Automation is such a big ingredient in savings. Think about reducing manual labor as the goal, but it's about reducing the overall cost.

Lock-in can give you benefits (like marriage - Adrian Cockroft).

Complexity is very expensive - that's where a lot of problems come from.
Want access to managed services (main reason you went to the cloud in teh 1st place). Don't try to achieve zero switching cost for something with little benefits.
