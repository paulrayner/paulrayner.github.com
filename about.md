  <p>I am from Perth, Australia, but choose to live, work and play with my amazing wife and two children in Denver, Colorado.</p> 

  <p>I can often be found enjoying barefoot running, bodyweight strength training, guitar playing, paleo eating, serving my church community, and good conversations with friends and family.</p>

  <p>I co-founded and co-lead <a href="http://bit.ly/ddd_den">DDD Denver</a>. Look for me speaking at local user groups, and at regional and international conferences.</p>

  <p>If you are looking for an expert hands-on team coach and design mentor in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), BDD with Cucumber, or lean/agile process I am available for consulting and training.</p>
