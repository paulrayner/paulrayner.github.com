<p>I am from Perth, Australia, but choose to live, work and play with my amazing wife and two children in Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>I can often be found walking our dog and enjoying the Colorado outdoors, guitar playing, serving my church community, and good conversations with friends and family.</p>

<p>I'm the founder and chair for the <a href="http://exploreddd.com">Explore DDD conference</a>. I co-founded and help lead <a href="http://bit.ly/ddd_den">DDD Denver</a>. Look for me speaking at local user groups, and at regional and international conferences.</p>

<p>If you are looking for an expert hands-on team coach and design mentor in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), BDD with Cucumber, or Lean/agile process I am available for consulting and training through my company, <a href="http://www.virtualgenius.com">Virtual Genius LLC.</a>.</p>
